---------------------------- SQL ---------------------------------

Each $user has his own SQL table named clickers_$user with two columns :
- reponse : an integer corresponding to a possible answer
- votes : the number of votes for the corresponding answer

A main table named clickers contains the ids of the users. It has two columns :
- name : the name of a $user
- voteid : the id he/she chose for his poll
